- Use TypeScript with strict mode. No implicit any; prefer explicit types for public API.
- Do not add runtime dependencies unless explicitly required. Dev dependencies are allowed.
- All library code lives under src/. Core sync in src/core/; async layer in src/async/. No React or framework-specific code.
- Never access window, document, or navigator at module top-level (SSR-safe). Check at call time inside functions.
- Repo execution guide (structure, order, testing, CI): docs/DEV-ARCHITECTURE.md. Behavior and API contract: docs/API.md and docs/ARCH.md (locked).
- Implement one module at a time; add tests with each module. No speculative features beyond docs/PRD.md.
- Packaging: ESM + CJS via tsup; exports map with types, import, require. Publish dist only.
