- Use TypeScript with strict mode. No implicit any; prefer explicit types for public API.
- Do not add runtime dependencies unless explicitly required. Dev dependencies are allowed.
- All library code lives under src/. Core (framework-agnostic) in src/core/; React-specific in src/react/.
- Never access window, document, or navigator at module top-level (SSR-safe). Check at call time inside functions.
- Public API must return structured results (e.g. { success, method, code?, error? }). No UI assumptions (no toasts, dialogs).
- Tests: Vitest for unit (jsdom), Playwright for E2E using demo app. Do not rely on clipboard or OS-specific APIs in E2E assertions.
- Single source of truth: docs/DEV-ARCHITECTURE.md. For architecture decisions and layout, read that first.
- Packaging: ESM + CJS via tsup; exports map with types, import, require. Publish dist only.
