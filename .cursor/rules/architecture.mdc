This repo is a **template** for building modern TypeScript npm libraries with zero runtime deps, strict types, tiered core engine, React layer (hook, component, action), unit + E2E tests, size gate, and changesets with npm Trusted Publishing.

**Single source of truth:** [docs/DEV-ARCHITECTURE.md](../../docs/DEV-ARCHITECTURE.md) — read it for goals, API contract, engine tiers, repo layout, testing, packaging, and release flow. Follow the implementation order when adding features.
