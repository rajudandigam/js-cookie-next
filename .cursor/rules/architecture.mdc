This repo is **js-cookie-next**: a vanilla browser cookie utility with zero runtime deps, strict TypeScript, Cookie Store API (async) with document.cookie fallback, CHIPS-aware options, and SSR-safe design.

**Single source of truth:** [docs/ARCH.md](../../docs/ARCH.md) and [docs/API.md](../../docs/API.md) — read them for architecture, module layout, API contract, and behavior. Follow them when implementing or changing the library.
